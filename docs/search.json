    "text": "Role: Real Estate Market Strategist Stack: Python, Excel, Tableau\nSummary:\nPerformed a five-year housing-market analysis for the Cleveland, OH Metropolitan Area (2019–2024) to evaluate investment performance and long-term affordability.\nCalculated 7.13 % annual price CAGR and 41 % total appreciation, benchmarking home-price-to-income ratio = 2.4×, well below the U.S. average (4.1×).\nKey Insights:\n- Cleveland remains significantly more affordable than national markets despite steady appreciation.\n- Single-family homes dominate sales volume, indicating strong liquidity for small investors.\n- Affordability stress in Cleveland has risen modestly but remains half the national level, signaling balanced growth.\nDeliverables:\n- Interactive charts showing median sale price trend, property-type liquidity, and mortgage affordability.\n- Visual dashboard used for strategic due-diligence presentations and market briefings.\nView Analysis PDF ↗\n\n\n\nRole: Consultant | Stack: Python, Excel, Tableau\nSummary:\nDeveloped a client-facing dashboard to communicate billable-hour performance and return on investment (ROI) across active projects.\nThe dashboard was designed for transparency on hourly-based engagements, allowing clients to clearly understand how billed hours compared with historical forecasts.\nAnalytical Approach:\nIterated on a Python forecasting script that generated high- and low-end estimates for billable hours using historical hourly contract data only.\nFixed-price projects were excluded to maintain consistent modeling assumptions.\nForecast results were combined with real-time billing data to visualize client ROI and highlight variance within expected ranges.\nConfidentiality Note:\nThis visualization represents only the portion of the dashboard that can be publicly shared.\nDue to client data sensitivity, financial sections showing revenue & campaign dollar values were cropped out.\nThe full dashboard included additional panels tracking cost per acquisition, print ad lead scoring, and marketing ROI components that cannot be displayed publicly.\nKey Insights:\n- Enhanced transparency by showing clients how their billed hours align with modeled expectations.\n- Communicated ROI of 86.9% (zero as breakeven) clearly and visually.\n- Provided clients a clear view of billing variance without exposing sensitive financial data.\nDeliverables:\n- Updated Python forecast script for new hourly engagements.\n- Secure, client-facing dashboard visualizing ROI and billed-hour variance.\n\n\n\nClient Engagement Financial Performance Dashboard (Cropped View)\n\n\n\n\n\nRole: Consultant | Stack: Python, Excel, Tableau\nSummary:\nDeveloped a Monte Carlo simulation framework to evaluate the feasibility of Diatech’s 2025 revenue target of $4.4 M under varying ad-spend and market conditions.\nThe analysis quantified risk and established statistically realistic revenue ranges aligned with industry performance trends.\nAnalytical Approach:\n- Ran 100,000 simulations modeling ad spend from $120 K–$700 K with variable ROAS multipliers (2× – 4×) and external inputs such as supply-chain recovery, tariff impact, and special-market contributions.\n- The December 2024 model showed a mean outcome near $4.08 M and only a 19 % probability of hitting the $4.4 M goal, even under aggressive assumptions.\n- The May 2025 revision, updated with real-world performance and macro inputs, projected a mean of ≈ $3.21 M with 0 % probability of achieving the target.\n- The results demonstrated that the $4.4 M goal exceeded what was achievable within the industry’s historical CAGR and realistic ad-efficiency scenarios.\nKey Insights:\n- The company’s growth target required external acceleration beyond organic performance.\n- Statistical modeling provided leadership with evidence to recalibrate revenue goals to a $3.2 M–$3.3 M range.\n- Highlighted the value of simulation modeling for risk-adjusted strategic planning.\nDeliverables:\n- Python-based simulation scripts for ad-spend and revenue forecasting.\n- Executive summary visuals comparing December and May scenarios.\n\n\n\nDiatech 2025 Adjusted Forecast Comparison"

    "text": "My work focuses on connecting insight to execution, where strategy, performance, and human judgment intersect.\n\nStrategic foresight: I use scenario planning and risk modeling to prepare for multiple futures, not just the probable one.\n\nExecution through alignment: I bring clarity, structure, and accountability to complex goals, ensuring people understand both the what and the why and the how.\n\nLeadership through empowerment: I believe that empowered teams outperform managed ones. Developing people is as strategic as developing a plan.\n\nData with perspective: I leverage analytics to tell a story, but I respect that intuition, timing, and lived experience can bend even the cleanest regression line."
