# About Me

I’m **Marquita Angelina McKim** — a strategist and commercial leader who believes that data informs decisions, but people, instinct, and resilience ultimately drive transformation.  

Over more than 15 years in business and market strategy, I’ve worked across gaming, healthcare, professional services, and emerging technology—building growth frameworks, guiding teams, and helping organizations make smarter, more sustainable choices.  

I use data to guide decisions but not to define them. I use insight to determine how and where we can push boundaries and take calculated risks that move us beyond the expected. To be the exception, we must operate exceptionally.

## Strategic Focus

My work focuses on connecting insight to execution, where strategy, performance, and human judgment intersect.  

- **Strategic foresight:** I use scenario planning and risk modeling to prepare for multiple futures, not just the probable one.  
- **Execution through alignment:** I bring clarity, structure, and accountability to complex goals, ensuring people understand both *the what* and *the why* and *the how*.  
- **Leadership through empowerment:** I believe that empowered teams outperform managed ones. Developing people is as strategic as developing a plan.  
- **Data with perspective:** I leverage analytics to tell a story, but I respect that intuition, timing, and lived experience can bend even the cleanest regression line.

## Guiding Philosophy

I'm wasn't supposed to be here, statistically; the odds were against me. Yet here I am, proof that variables change when people do. That’s why I lead with both logic and belief, because strategy without conviction is just arithmetic.

True strategy lives in the balance between analysis and instinct, where the numbers point the way, but people decide the direction.
