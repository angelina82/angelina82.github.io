## Cleveland Housing Affordability & Portfolio Analysis
**Role:** Real Estate Market Strategist 
**Stack:** Python, Excel, Tableau  

**Summary:**  
Performed a five-year housing-market analysis for the **Cleveland, OH Metropolitan Area (2019–2024)** to evaluate investment performance and long-term affordability.  
Calculated **7.13 % annual price CAGR** and **41 % total appreciation**, benchmarking **home-price-to-income ratio = 2.4×**, well below the U.S. average (4.1×).  

**Key Insights:**  
- Cleveland remains significantly more affordable than national markets despite steady appreciation.  
- Single-family homes dominate sales volume, indicating strong liquidity for small investors.  
- Affordability stress in Cleveland has risen modestly but remains half the national level, signaling balanced growth.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Interactive charts showing median sale price trend, property-type liquidity, and mortgage affordability.  
- Visual dashboard used for **strategic due-diligence presentations** and **market briefings**.

## Client Engagement Billable-Hour Forecast Dashboard
**Role:** Consultant | **Stack:** Python, Excel, Tableau

**Summary:**  
Developed a **client-facing dashboard** to communicate billable-hour performance and return on investment (ROI) across active projects.  
The dashboard was designed for transparency on **hourly-based engagements**, allowing clients to clearly understand how billed hours compared with historical forecasts.

**Analytical Approach:**  
Iterated on a **Python forecasting script** that generated high- and low-end estimates for billable hours using **historical hourly contract data only**.  
Fixed-price projects were excluded to maintain consistent modeling assumptions.  
Forecast results were combined with real-time billing data to visualize client ROI and highlight variance within expected ranges.

**Confidentiality Note:**  
This visualization represents only the **portion of the dashboard that can be publicly shared**.  
Due to **client data sensitivity**, financial sections showing revenue & campaign dollar values were cropped out.  
The full dashboard included additional panels tracking cost per acquisition, print ad lead scoring, and marketing ROI components that cannot be displayed publicly.

**Key Insights:**  
- Enhanced transparency by showing clients how their billed hours align with modeled expectations.  
- Communicated **ROI of 86.9%** (zero as breakeven) clearly and visually.  
- Provided clients a clear view of billing variance without exposing sensitive financial data.

**Deliverables:**  
- Updated Python forecast script for new hourly engagements.  
- Secure, client-facing dashboard visualizing ROI and billed-hour variance.

## Diatech 2025 — Monte Carlo Revenue Forecast and Scenario Update
**Role:** Consultant | **Stack:** Python, Excel, Tableau

**Summary:**  
Developed a **Monte Carlo simulation framework** to evaluate the feasibility of Diatech’s 2025 revenue target of **$4.4 M** under varying ad-spend and market conditions.  
The analysis quantified risk and established statistically realistic revenue ranges aligned with industry performance trends.

**Analytical Approach:**  
- Ran **100,000 simulations** modeling ad spend from **$120 K–$700 K** with variable **ROAS multipliers (2× – 4×)** and external inputs such as supply-chain recovery, tariff impact, and special-market contributions.  
- The **December 2024 model** showed a mean outcome near **$4.08 M** and only a **19 % probability** of hitting the $4.4 M goal, even under aggressive assumptions.  
- The **May 2025 revision**, updated with real-world performance and macro inputs, projected a mean of **≈ $3.21 M** with **0 % probability** of achieving the target.  
- The results demonstrated that the $4.4 M goal exceeded what was achievable within the industry’s historical CAGR and realistic ad-efficiency scenarios.

**Key Insights:**  
- The company’s growth target required external acceleration beyond organic performance.  
- Statistical modeling provided leadership with evidence to recalibrate revenue goals to a **$3.2 M–$3.3 M** range.  
- Highlighted the value of simulation modeling for **risk-adjusted strategic planning**.

**Deliverables:**  
- Python-based simulation scripts for ad-spend and revenue forecasting.  
- Executive summary visuals comparing December and May scenarios.
